    "As with activity classification, we will featurize our time series signal and throw those features into a classifier. For AF we will build a two-class classifier using the inter-beat-interval time series. This time series can be derived by taking the difference between successive QRS complex locations as provided by the Pan-Tompkins algorithm in the previous videos. We source our features from a couple submissions to the [Computing in Cardiology Challenge 2017](https://physionet.org/content/challenge-2017/1.0.0/). \n",

Many of the features we want can be computed on an irregular time series, but some, especially frequency domain features, cannot. In that case, we will first have to make this uniform by using interpolation.\n"
