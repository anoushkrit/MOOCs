#### Assessing the feasibility of ML Projects

1. These are the cost drivers.
2.      I Problem Difficulty
        II Accuracy Requirement
        III Data Availability



No. of parameters is proportional to the amount of data,
but that is not practically true.

Defining the number of parameters in a Neural Network is
just a design choice.

5. Usually you should use pre-trained models for the tasks which have been
performed earlier by the researchers or by the industry.

6. https://youtu.be/tBUK1_cHu-8?t=1699. In this, Josh Tobin from Open AI describes that in Supervised Learning it is
a still a huge problem to test a DL Model on a dataset on which the model doesn't
 have any clue (i.e. When test data doesn't reflect the Validation Data) it will make a lot
 of errors while predicting.

#### Assessing the feasibility of Reinforcement Learning Projects.

This is a tough question to answer and is out of the scope of this course.
