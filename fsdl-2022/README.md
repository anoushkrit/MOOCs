We use smoke tests in ML since we cannot have precise test case scenarios like software engineering pre-compiled programs. 

Example Smoke Tests:
1.  Checking whether your model can generalise/memorise a small part of the full dataset mixture. (pytorch lightning: `--overfit_batches` implements this test case)
2.  
Tools for setting expectations or ranges in the data for testing the data anomalies when someone starts feeding wrong data `great_expectations`.
