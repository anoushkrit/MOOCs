### Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow

#### Week 1
In Week 1, We hit back to the Image Data Generator and using the `flow_from_directory` function for automatic labelling of the datasets.

#### Week 2

In this week, we will work on the powerful functions provided by TensorFlow for data preprocessing on-the-fly.
The data augmentation itself is memory intensive task, and some of the worth mentioning libraries include `imgaug` which stands for "Image Augmentation".

Techniques used prominently in Image Augmentation:
1. Cropping
2. Rotating
3. Flipping
4. Shifting
5. Color Change
6. Histogram Equalization
7.
