### Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow

#### Week 1
In Week 1, We hit back to the Image Data Generator and using the `flow_from_directory` function for automatic labelling of the datasets.

#### Week 2

In this week, we will work on the powerful functions provided by TensorFlow for data preprocessing on-the-fly.
The data augmentation itself is memory intensive task, and some of the worth mentioning libraries include `imgaug` which stands for "Image Augmentation".

Techniques used prominently in Image Augmentation:
1. Cropping
2. Rotating
3. Flipping
4. Shifting
5. Color Change
6. Histogram Equalization

**Validation Accuracy** fluctuates a lot if the augmentation performed on Training Set is not performed on the Validation set appropriately as said by Laurence Moroney in [Augmentation on Horses v Humans](https://www.coursera.org/learn/convolutional-neural-networks-tensorflow/lecture/Faeaq/exploring-augmentation-with-horses-vs-humans)
